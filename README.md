This test have 2 part

1 - algorithm.dart
    I use Dart on this test. if u want to run this code on desktop, u can use "dart .\algorithm.dart" command. 
    If u run on a web IDE, I already try on "https://dartpad.dev/?" but it's not support 'dart:io' lib. 
2 - Joke
    I already build an apk file and upload on Google drive: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/176EQfFMCzunvzhbSbh-MqYAhlLZnnpd1/view?usp=sharing". I suggest test this app on real device or simulator device because it's have cache manage task, u can ez to clear cache if u want to try on web IDE, I suggest "https://flutlab.io/", I haven't try to run this app on this web yet but I think it's okay
